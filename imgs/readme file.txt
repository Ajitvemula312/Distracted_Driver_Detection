# Driver Distraction Classification

This project aims to classify driver distraction based on images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and pre-trained models such as VGG19 and EfficientNetB3.

## Introduction
Driver distraction is a critical issue that affects road safety. This project focuses on classifying driver distraction based on images captured from inside a vehicle. Three models are implemented: a custom CNN, VGG19, and EfficientNetB3. The models are trained and evaluated using the provided dataset.

## Setup
To run the code, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the following dependencies:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- EfficientNetB3 (optional, if using EfficientNetB3 model)

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Start Jupyter Notebook and open the provided .ipynb file:
